# Project Description: 3D Reconstruction using Structure from Motion

This project aims to apply computer vision techniques to reconstruct 3D scenes and estimate camera poses using the Structure from Motion (SfM) method. SfM is a technique that utilizes a series of 2D images to reconstruct the 3D structure of a scene and produce point cloud-based 3D models. The principle of stereoscopic photogrammetry is used in SfM to calculate the relative 3D poses of an object from stereo pairs by using triangulation methods.
